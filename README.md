# PoliVote

A blockchain-powered platform for transparent and decentralized political voting and civic engagement, addressing real-world issues like voter apathy, election fraud, and lack of transparency in political processes — all on-chain using Clarity on the Stacks blockchain.

---

## Overview

PoliVote consists of four main smart contracts that together form a secure, verifiable, and inclusive ecosystem for citizens to participate in polls, petitions, and community governance:

1. **Citizen Token Contract** – Issues and manages identity-linked tokens for verified participants.
2. **Voting DAO Contract** – Handles on-chain voting for polls, petitions, and proposals.
3. **Petition Management Contract** – Creates, signs, and escalates petitions with threshold-based actions.
4. **Rewards Distribution Contract** – Incentivizes participation through token rewards and staking.

---

## Features

- **Verified citizen tokens** tied to real-world identity proofs (via oracles) to prevent fraud  
- **Decentralized voting** on political issues, candidates, or community decisions  
- **On-chain petitions** with automatic escalation to authorities upon reaching signatures  
- **Reward mechanisms** for active voters and petition creators  
- **Transparent audit trails** for all votes and fund flows (if donations are involved)  
- **Anti-sybil measures** through token staking and verification  
- **Integration with off-chain data** for real-time event triggering
